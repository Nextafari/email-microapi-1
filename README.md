## A Dockerized Micro-service for sending Email Notifications by Team-Fierce

# Description:
This is an Email micro-service that sends emails using Swagger UI template and an API. It was built to avoid development teams having to configure mail over and over on projects involving a micro-services infrastructure.

It was built using [Django-Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) and a Docker file was included for easy development. 
Documentation is managed by Swagger with the drf-yasg module.
